Using a combination of AR and GPS, people can use this app through their smartphone's camera to locate and navigate to their friends' or colleagues' location. This app also has group and chat system that allows people to chat together and share their locations. (Currently on Android only)

## List of the app features:

- Augmented reality route tracking
- Group with chat system
- Private user to user chat
- Sharing location in group or private chat
- User sign-up/sign-in with customizable profile page

## Download and Use

To download raw project, simply Clone this rep and open folder using a Java based IDE (preferably Android Studio).

To try this app in Android Studio, Run the app using an Android smartphone or an emulator (which can be made in through Android Studio).

Note: This app requires constant Internet connection and GPS tracking to work properly, so using an emulator means you might need to mock your location
